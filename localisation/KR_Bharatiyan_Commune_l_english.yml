### Event Texts ###
beng.47.t:0 "Invite Ho Chi Minh to Calcutta?"
beng.47.d:0 "In Paris, a group of Indochinese revolutionaries under the leadership of Nguyen Sinh Con, also known as Ho Chi Minh, have announced their decision to form a united leftist government in exile whose declared goal is to topple German colonial rule. The Kaiserreich’s administration of the former French colony is shaky at best, with a revolutionary conscious indigenous populace and a steadily growing proletariat in the cities constantly agitating for national independence. It has been suggested that our government invite Ho Chi Minh and his comrades to Calcutta and place all available resources at their disposition. With an Indochinese government in exile based in Calcutta, we will be able to help and direct our comrades in their struggle against German capitalist tyranny. However, the decision is entirely in the hands of the cabinet."
beng.47.a:0 "Extend a formal invitation to the Indochinese revolutionaries!"
beng.47.b:0 "He'll be more comfortable in Paris, I'm sure."
beng.48.t:0 "Ho Chi Minh is Invited to Calcutta"
beng.48.d:0 "Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Indochinese Syndicalist Party has been invited to Calcutta to form a government in exile aimed at fermenting revolution in our former colony, currently held by the Germans. This could be a easy way to destabilise the German colonial empire."
beng.48.a:0 "Bon voyage, comrade Ho Chi Minh!"
beng.48.b:0 "Can't risk the trip, frightfully sorry."
beng.49.t:0 "Ho Chi Minh Arrives in Calcutta"
beng.49.d:0 "Indochinese revolutionaries under the leadership of Nguyen Sinh Con, also known as Ho Chi Minh, has arrived this morning at the riverine port of Calcutta from Paris to establish their own government in exile there. The Bharatiya Commune government decided to support their independence movement against the German colonial rule in Southeast Asia - threatening the region's fragile stability, especially when the German economy is still trying to recover itself from the effects of Black Monday. Will Ho's struggle against colonialism succeed or not is a matter of the other day."
beng.49.a:0 "Wonderful!"
beng.49.b:0 "That's worrying!"
beng.50.t:0 "The Place of the Red Raj in the World"
beng.50.d:0 "With India united behind the Calcutta government and the provinces of the pretender governments brought under Socialist administration, the cabinet has begun to debate what course we should take internationally. A logical decision would be to seek an alignment with the International and thus formally take our rightful place among the great Syndicalist nations of the world. Others, however, argue that we ought to make our own bloc of alliances – a force of Socialism with an oriental face. Such a course would definitely allow us greater freedom when it comes to spreading the revolution, but might cost us the technological benefit of associating with the great armies of the International."
beng.50.a:0 "We shall be the Internationale's Sword in Asia!"
beng.50.b:0 "On our own, Asia shall be painted RED!"
beng.50.c:0 "Let us rebuild India in splendid isolation."
beng.51.t:0 "India Wants to Join the Internationale"
beng.51.d:0 "The fragmented remains of the British Raj have finally been reunited under the aegis of the leftist Calcutta government. As if this wasn't good enough news for the worldwide proletariat, the new Indian government has requested to be aligned as a member of the Internationale!"
beng.51.a:0 "Workers of the World, Unite!"
beng.51.b:0 "We have no use for Bolsheviks in turbans..."
beng.64.t:0 "Fostering a Revolution in Indochina"
beng.64.d:0 "With the revolution secured at home, it is now time to turn our gaze to the rest of occupied Asia. Indochina is one of the nearest examples of continued European colonialism, having been conquered by the French at the turn of the last century, before being handed over to the Germans after the Entente’s defeat in the Weltkrieg. However, because of the chaotic circumstances of the Kaiserreich’s takeover, the Germans never quite managed to secure themselves in the role as colonial masters, which has resulted in the colony witnessing several uprisings of various nationalist groupings. Should we initiate support for the leftist and anti-colonialist movements within Indochina?"
beng.64.a:0 "Dispatch advisers, material and volunteers!"
beng.64.b:0 "Bring in Ho Chi Minh to spearhead a revolutionary insurgency!"
beng.64.c:0 "We have no interests in expanding the revolution beyond India."
