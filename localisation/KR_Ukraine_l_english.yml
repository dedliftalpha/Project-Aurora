### Events ###
ukraine.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with the help of Germany on 25 January 1918. Yet still the national situation is unstable. Germany makes us sell our goods only to its allies, ethnic Russians and pro-Russian population dream of the unification with Russia, Syndicalists gain popularity in the biggest cities, while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that Ukraine should be only for the Ukrainians and that our Kingdom is no more than a mere German puppet."
ukraine.1.a:0 "Fascinating."
ukraine.2.t:0 "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d:0 "Even our government is divided and Pavel Skoropadsky does his best to solve the antagonisms between the army, which consists in general of the former officers of the Russian Imperial Army and other Ukrainian ministers, who support our current position in Mitteleuropa. All these problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the farmers and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their agricultural products in Europe."
ukraine.2.a:0 "Don`t provoke the peasants."
ukraine.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking..."
ukraine.3.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
ukraine.4.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d:0 "Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its grain trade with the German Empire to maintain its economic security. However, the current economic and social troubles have meant that the Germans are now more interested in protecting their own farmers than subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us - without money from German trade, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their position in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a:0 "We're still the breadbasket of Europe. Right?"
ukraine.5.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis different pro-Russian movements were rather weak and didn't pose much of a threat to our government. But this crisis led to the growth of these organisations. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev Mikhail Bulgakov proclaimed the unification of the 3 biggest movements into 1, called 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Church, population of the Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many officers, this movement could provoke instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a:0 "We really must protest!"
ukraine.6.t:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky returns from Africa"
ukraine.6.d:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a young and talented officer, returns to Ukraine. He was a member of the voluntary Ukrainian division, which helped our German allies in Mittelafrika. His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovsky was promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack disivion ('Serdyutskaya' division), which belongs to the elite of the Ukrainian army."
ukraine.6.a:0 "Welcome home!"
ukraine.7.t:0 "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d:0 "Dmitri Dontsov, an ideologist of Ukrainian nationalism has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the Ukrainians to fight against the pro-Polish government. Now he claims that the crisis exposed the weakness of our government and that`s why Ukraine should be ruled by the real Ukrainian patriots. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine. This could be dangerous for the cabinet since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a:0 "Em...Welcome home..."
ukraine.8.t:0 "Khrushchev Criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social-democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government uses extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty. To further this he has proposed a new programme of social reforms, which should help Ukraine overcome this crisis. He is going to present his plan in the Rada."
ukraine.8.a:0 "Extreme measures? Hmm... sounds like BOLSHEVISM!"
ukraine.9.t:0 "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.9.d:0 "As one of the few Social Democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an extremely powerful influence over the Ukrainian peasantry. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has called openly for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them dangerous ideas..."
ukraine.9.a:0 "Arrest Khrushchev, dissolve the Rada and restore the Hetmanate."
ukraine.9.b:0 "Dismiss Skorapadsky and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.9.c:0 "Guarantee free elections - we need time to consider every aspect."
ukraine.9.e:0 "There is no need for drastic action just yet."
ukraine.10.t:0 "Ukrainian Recovery"
ukraine.10.d:0 "Though Khrushchev was arrested, social problems still provoke political instability. A lot of young workers and peasants join the syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements and groups. If we want to save Ukraine from the worst, we should start a recovery programme. The most important aim is to help the poorest grain-growers in the Central Ukraine. The majority of the population still can`t use electricity in their houses. Something must be done."
ukraine.10.a:0 "Borrow money from Germany"
ukraine.10.b:0 "We can use our own resources. Time to increase taxes."
ukraine.10.c:0 "We're fine as it is!"
ukraine.11.t:0 "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.11.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan, which they want to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. The situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help our ally."
ukraine.11.a:0 "Very well grant them the money"
ukraine.11.b:0 "Who cares?"
ukraine.12.t:0 "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.12.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine. It is, after all, a much better place to invest than Eastern Poland!"
ukraine.12.a:0 "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"
ukraine.13.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.13.d:0 "Our government could finally electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Ukraine has finally begun to recover from Black Monday."
ukraine.13.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.14.t:0 "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
ukraine.14.d:0 "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.14.a:0 "We can use our own resources. Time to raise the taxes."
ukraine.14.b:0 "These reforms weren't necessary anyway..."
ukraine.15.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Ukraine has started to recover from Black Monday."
ukraine.15.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.16.t:0 "Ukrainian Industry"
ukraine.16.d:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it`s time to do something in the Eastern part of the Ukraine. A lot of workers have joined the syndicalists or different separatist movenments, because our state can`t guarantee workplaces for them. All these factories, built by the Tsarist government, should be modernised as fast as we can. But we need investments!"
ukraine.16.a:0 "Borrow money from Berlin. Again."
ukraine.16.b:0 "Use our own taxes"
ukraine.16.c:0 "This is too expensive..."
ukraine.17.t:0 "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.17.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine. But the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Will we help our ally?"
ukraine.17.a:0 "Very well, give them the money."
ukraine.17.b:0 "There is a crisis in Germany, you know"
ukraine.18.t:0 "Germany Has Granted Us Another Loan"
ukraine.18.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the syndicalist movements there."
ukraine.18.a:0 "Very well"
ukraine.19.t:0 "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine Complete"
ukraine.19.d:0 "The workers of Eastern Ukraine have got new workplaces. As a result a majority of the population has become loyal to us. We have recovered from Black Monday and defeated all the syndicalist trade unions in the East!"
ukraine.19.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.20.t:0 "Germany Has Declined To Grant Us a Second Loan!"
ukraine.20.d:0 "Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.20.a:0 "We can use our own resources. Time to increase taxes."
ukraine.20.b:0 "Too damn expensive!"
ukraine.21.t:0 "Fraud in the Treasury!"
ukraine.21.d:0 "Taxes, which we decided to raise, were partially plundered by officials in the Ministry of Finance. If we want to finish our industrialisation in full, we should increase taxes again or wait approximately 2,5 years to collect the necessary sum of money."
ukraine.21.a:0 "Collect the taxes now!"
ukraine.21.b:0 "We are not going to force events."
ukraine.22.t:0 "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine is Complete"
ukraine.22.d:0 "The workers of Eastern Ukraine have got new workplaces. As a result a majority of the population has become loyal to us. We have recovered from Black Monday and defeated all the syndicalist trade unions in the East!"
ukraine.22.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.23.t:0 "Poverty Among the Peasants"
ukraine.23.d:0 "Our government collected additional taxes too harshly which has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our industrialisation ended with a total failure, the situation in Ukraine is even worse than before!"
ukraine.23.a:0 "These damned thieves in the government! Hang them high!"
ukraine.24.t:0 "Plots in the Kingdom of the Ukraine!"
ukraine.24.d:0 "Though the leadership of the Ukrainian syndicalist party has been arrested, our economical policy didn't calm the population of our country. Amidst the commotion, the Ukrainian nationalists and the pro-Russian groups have decided to launch a plot against Hetman Skoropadsky. The government have lost the remains of the support and the citizens in Kiev are waiting for the new authority."
ukraine.24.a:0 "'Faith and Nation' takes control of the apparatus of state!"
ukraine.24.b:0 "Dontsov and his Sich Riflemen secure the capital!"
ukraine.25.t:0 "The Language Issue"
ukraine.25.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has headed the government during the strongest crisis since 1918. But before improving the economical problems, Nikita Khrushchev has to do something about the pro-Russian movements, which try to influence our electorate in the most industrial-developed parts of Ukraine. One of the biggest domestic problems existing in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto the Russian language is used by majority of the population, but the usage is prohibited in the state institutions."
ukraine.25.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.25.b:0 "Arrest the pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.26.t:0 "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
ukraine.26.d:0 "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumsky oppose Khrushchev`s decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in the state institutions. They claim that this decision won`t unify our country and that free usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in the Southern and Eastern Ukrainian regions."
ukraine.26.a:0 "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.26.b:0 "All right, all right. Restore the status quo"
ukraine.27.t:0 "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.27.d:0 "Unfortunately leaders of the different pro-Russian movements escaped from Ukraine. Mikhail Bulgakov announced, that 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of the Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.27.a:0 "Another problem!"
ukraine.28.t:0 "Confrontation with 'Kulaks'"
ukraine.28.d:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Of course, they are hated by the majority of the peasants, but they are the only group of the farmers who are able to fulfil our consumer needs. At first Khrushchev wanted to divide their lands between other peasants, but maybe it is too dangerous for our weak economy?"
ukraine.28.a:0 "Raise their taxes. For now..."
ukraine.28.b:0 "Initiate land redistribution!"
ukraine.29.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.29.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the 'Kulaks' and to spend this money on the poorest peasants led to stabilisation of our agriculture. 60-70% of the state and private farms are now self-supporting. As a result we can solve other, more difficult problems in our economy, because we have support in the villages and farms."
ukraine.29.a:0 "That`s great."
ukraine.30.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.30.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation ended in a total failure, the situation in Ukraine is even worse than before!"
ukraine.30.a:0 "Syndicalism doesn't always work"
ukraine.31.t:0 "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.31.d:0 "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvaniy gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary forces sweeping the country. Now that Khrushchev's initial program has been implemented, many interest groups within Ukraine are asking for Royal Power to intervene to create a more sustainable order."
ukraine.31.a:0 "The landlords have given up enough, and want to return to the old ways"
ukraine.31.b:0 "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government"
ukraine.31.c:0 "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.31.d:0 "Perhaps the best option would be to compromise, and keep Khrushchev at the helm"
ukraine.32.t:0 "Social Chaos in the Ukraine!"
ukraine.32.d:0 "Distressing news - conditions in the countryside have driven our peasants into radicalism! They are expropriating the estates of absentee proprietors for themselves, and there are even cases of resident landlords being lynched. Law and order has broken down, and the King is burned in effigy! Worse, our urban workers are rallying behind the cause, and there are daily demonstrations on the streets of Kiev calling for a Ukrainian Social Republic!"
ukraine.32.a:0 "Send in the army and crush all who oppose the Royal Will!"
ukraine.32.b:0 "The Government Collapses and Khrushchev takes over the Republic"
ukraine.33.t:0 "New Ukrainian Foreign Policy"
ukraine.33.d:0 "Now that Khrushchev is firmly in control of Ukraine, it is perhaps time to reconsider the country's foreign policy commitments. Integration within Germany's Mitteleuropa is no longer as beneficial as it initially was, and there are other powers which share our ideological values."
ukraine.33.a:0 "We will orientate towards the Syndicalist powers"
ukraine.33.b:0 "We shall stay within the German sphere of influence"
ukraine.33.c:0 "We shall build Socialism in the Ukraine by ourselves"
ukraine.34.t:0 "Revolution in the Breadbasket of Mitteleuropa!"
ukraine.34.d:0 "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted our alliance! Many hotheads in the general staff suggest military action to punish the Ukraine, however, doing so would be extremely unwise as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe. Instead members of the Abwehr suggest that we use our ties with many important members of the Ukrainian armed forces to instigate a coup. How shall we react to this betrayal?"
ukraine.34.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.34.b:0 "Covert operations will be good enough."
ukraine.35.c:0 "Such betrayal will not be tolerated!"
ukraine.35.t:0 "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d:0 "Following our decision to leave the hated Mitteleuropa System, the German military mission present in country since 1918 finally left!"
ukraine.35.a:0 "Finally they leave!"
ukraine.36.t:0 "Foreign policy"
ukraine.36.d:0 "With Ukraine finally free from German capitalist oppression we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community. While many are arguing for immediate alliance with other Syndicalist nations, it might be wise to remain neutral to rebuild our country."
ukraine.36.a:0 "We must join arms with France"
ukraine.36.b:0 "Isolationism, we must organise our country"
ukraine.37.t:0 "Ukraine Wants to Join the International"
ukraine.37.d:0 "The government of the Ukraine has announced recently that they want to join the Syndicalist bloc. It's not a sudden move because pro-Syndicalist policy is popular in many circles including the government and army. Do we want Ukrainian workers and peasants joining the crusade against bloodthirsty Germans and rotten imperialist Canadian pigs?"
ukraine.37.a:0 "Yes! We shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
ukraine.37.b:0 "Rather not."
ukraine.38.t:0 "We Join the International"
ukraine.38.d:0 "The French and British are happy to see us joining the common cause - destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are part of the Syndicalist bloc."
ukraine.38.a:0 "This time we will win!"
ukraine.39.t:0 "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d:0 "German agitators with the help of reactionary officers and a part of the armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. The country is in chaos, how will the situation develop?"
ukraine.39.a:0 "The reactionary putschists secure the capital!"
ukraine.39.b:0 "Red militias defend the capital!"
ukraine.40.t:0 "Military Coup in the Ukraine"
ukraine.40.d:0 "Members of German military mission together with parts of the Ukrainian armed forces have successfully seized control of Kiev, overthrowing the Ukrainian Socialist government and replacing it with one loyal to the German Empire. We have once again secured Ukraine as a member of Mitteleuropa and prevented the expansion of Syndicalist influence!"
ukraine.40.a:0 "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t:0 "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"
ukraine.41.d:0 "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. What shall we do now?"
ukraine.41.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.41.b:0 "War will solve this!"
ukraine.42.t:0 "New Ukrainian Foreign Policy"
ukraine.42.d:0 "Now that Khrushchev was overthrown by conservatives, it is perhaps time to reconsider the country's foreign policy commitments, which were shaped during the brief rule of Khrushchev. The only way to secure our independence in this unstable is to ally with the German Empire once again...."
ukraine.42.a:0 "Isolationism will protect the Ukraine!"
ukraine.42.b:0 "We will orientate towards Mitteleuropa once again!"
ukraine.43.t:0 "Ukraine wants to return to Mitteleuropa!"
ukraine.43.d:0 "Conservative members of Ukrainian society have overthrown Khrushchev and his Socialists. Now the new Ukrainian government wants to once again join our alliance in order to protect the independence of their state. Do we want to allow Ukraine to re-join our alliance?"
ukraine.43.a:0 "Welcome back!"
ukraine.43.b:0 "They betrayed us once, they will do so again!"
ukraine.44.t:0 "German military mission returns to Ukraine"
ukraine.44.d:0 "Following our decision to once again realign with Mitteleuropa, the German military mission that has been forcefully removed from our homeland returns to oversee the training of our armed forces and help us reform them into a truly modern fighting force!"
ukraine.44.a:0 "Welcome back!"
ukraine.45.t:0 "Donbass Industry"
ukraine.45.d:0 "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable. Khrushchev now has a good chance to continue his reforms. His long-term aim is to develop industry in the East of Ukraine. We can just re-open old factories and modernize them a little or launch a formation of a new industrial region. Which way seems to be more profitable?"
ukraine.45.a:0 "Invest money in our old factories"
ukraine.45.b:0 "Direct state funds to create new factories!"
ukraine.46.t:0 "Donbass Industry"
ukraine.46.d:0 "Our long-term programme of the formation of the new industrial region was successful. We have raised our industrial capacity and are ready now to take part in the international politics as an independent country."
ukraine.46.a:0 "Perfect, just perfect"
ukraine.47.t:0 "Free Elections in the Ukraine"
ukraine.47.d:0 "Pavel Skoropadsky has decided to hold free elections in Ukraine, but opinion polls show that the Ukrainian syndicalist party led by Khrushchev will easily win these elections - resulting in Pavel Skoropadsky losing his post. Maybe we should reach an agreement with the pro-Russian and Nationalist forces to save Ukraine from Syndicalism?"
ukraine.47.a:0 "Strike a bargain with the rightist parties against Khrushchev"
ukraine.47.b:0 "The elections must go ahead without interference!"

The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov's 'White Guard' don't try to point out the possible ways of the reconciliation, but shows that the potential separatists and spies of the foreign powers still hide among the Ukrainian population and can try to take power in the country, if Ukraine will become weaker."
