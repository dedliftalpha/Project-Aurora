prf.0.t:0 "Introduction to the Princely Federation"
prf.0.d:0 "India finally achieved its de-facto independence in the aftermath of the British Revolution of 1925 as the Raj finally collapsed on itself. Rising to the mantle of governance was the Rajput maharaja of Bikaner, Ganga Singh whose authoritarian style of governing the newly freed Indian Dominion soon put him at odds with the leftist civilian opposition centred around the Indian National Congress and its militant underground supporters. Within months the INC’s denouncement of Singh’s negotiated Anglo-Indian Treaty brought the sub-continent to civil war. It was in this chaotic time that the southern princely states, citing the Anglo-Indian Treaty and numerous legal transgression of Ganga Singh as motivation, united behind Osman Ali Khan, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and declared him the true vice-roy of the Indian Dominion. As the civil war escalated into a confusing quagmire of violence Ali Khan failed to invade Singh’s northern power base, but succeeded in rooting out Socialist enclaves in Bombay and also prevented both the Delhi and Calcutta government from invading the Deccan Plateau. When peace finally came, the Princely Federation soon went about organising a true nationalist successor government to the Raj, with Osman Ali Khan serving as Nizam-al-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm) and his fellow princes serving in an advisory as well as legislatively role in the so-called Council of Princes. By 1936, the Princely Federation is a brittle state, but never the less the closest India has to a conservative native government."
